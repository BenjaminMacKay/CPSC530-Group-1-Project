"""
Frequency (Monobit) Test
REFERENCE: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf (pg. 2-2 to 2-3)

Purpose: used to determine the randomness of a binary string.
    Tests the proportion of zeroes and ones for the entire sequence, determining  
    whether the proportions are approximately the same. 
    For a random string, the proportions should be about the same.
    Tests the "uniformity" property.

To run: randomnessTestMonobit.py random.txt
