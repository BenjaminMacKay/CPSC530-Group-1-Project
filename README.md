Functioning command line RPS game that pits a player against a pseudo-random CPU.
Intended to collect the input of the player, the win/loss result, and time taken to make a decision for the purpose of deriving TRNG from human gameplay.

Results of a single game are appended to 'data.txt' contained in the same directory as the program, in order: "Player move (0, 1, 2), Win/Loss/Tie (1/0/2), Time in ticks".

.NET 6.0 or greater required to run.
To use, extract .zip to desired directory and run.
